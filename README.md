# Chicken Mount Datapack

This repository contains a Minecraft Java 1.21.x datapack that summons a personalized chicken mount for each player. Place the folder in your world save under `datapacks` and reload the world.

## Usage
- Run `/function chicken_mount:summon_chicken_mount` as a player to spawn your mount and instantly ride it.
- Each player receives a unique mount; calling the function again replaces your previous mount.
